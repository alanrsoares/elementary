React ES6 Starter Kit
=====================

## Prerequisites:

## Application Dependencies

All the dependencies required for the build system, testing and so on are managed with npm and defined in `package.json`.
They can be installed with:

npm install
```

## Running the Application

You can run `npm start` to fire up the application on `http://localhost:8080` or `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` (with live reload).
